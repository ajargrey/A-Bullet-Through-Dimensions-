# A-Bullet-Through-Dimensions-
A 2D Shooter Platformer Game in Godot

A game made in 9 days for Godot Wild Jam #10, using Godot 3.1.1.

Due to glitches in our universe, AI and alien apes are taking control over the earth...
bend laws of space and time, teleport, revert gravity, freeze time
and blast your way through the horde of enemies, lava lakes, and walls
that no one else can pass through...
